<!--FAQ
  
Do I need to have music or coding experience to participate in Presto Hacks?
  No! We will have workshops to teach beginners how to build a basic website (in HTML). We will also have a prize category for the best beginner project!
Do I need to submit a project?
  No - you are still eligible for swag even if you only attend the workshops and game sessions.
What if I cannot make a portion of the event?
  You are still welcome to participate - hackers can choose their level of involvement. Please communicate with your teammates about your absence if this is the case. 
I’ve heard that it is not uncommon for hackathon participants to stay up all night coding - will I be able to sleep during the event?
  Absolutely! Synchronous hackathon activities are usually held during the day, with the exception of a few games. If submitting a project, you can find teammates with similar expectations of time commitment to coding as you. 
Do I need to be in a team of 4?
  No! Hackers can work by themselves or with anywhere between 1 and 3 other hackers. 
What if I am not getting along with my teammate(s)?
  Please notify a Presto Hacks organizer in the Discord so we can resolve the issue. You will be able to identify the organizers by the color of our usernames in the Discord. 
Do you have any advice for beginner hackers?
  Go with the flow! It’s ok if you don’t understand everything. If you have any questions, please ask the Presto Hacks executive team!

You can also ask any questions at prestohacks@gmail.com, or during our “Survival Guide to Hacking” event after the Presto Hacks opening ceremony (Oct. 22nd). We hope to see you at Presto Hacks!
